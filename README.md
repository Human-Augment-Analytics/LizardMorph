# React + Flask LizardMorph App
This app is built on the machine learning toolbox ml-morph. This app has a pre-trained model to predict 34 landmarks on lizard anole x-rays.

## Structure

- **Frontend**: Located in `frontend/`, built with React.
- **Backend**: Located in `backend/`, powered by Flask.

### Setup Instructions

#### Backend
1. Navigate to the `backend` folder.
2. Since the predictor is too big for this platform, download here: https://gatech.box.com/s/qky0pu7hd3y0b8okvl3r7zgfiaj961vb
3. Paste the predictor into the backend folder
4. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. Run the Flask server:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

#### Frontend
1. Install node.js and add it to the PATH.
2. Navigate to the `frontend` folder.
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the React app:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
## Vignette
1. Open a terminal and activate the backend with the instructions from above
2. Open another terminal and activate the frontend with the instructions from above
3. Navigate to http://localhost:5000 
4. Hit upload on the webpage and select the picture from the folder sample_image in the project directory
5. Notice output.xml, output.tps, output.csv appear in project directory
6. Image should appear in the web browser:

7. Landmarks on image can be moved to fix predictions
8. Image can be viewed in three ways: original upload, color contrasted or inverted color
9. Image can be downloaded for records
